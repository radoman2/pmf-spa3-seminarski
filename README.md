# Term paper in DSA3 class
In this term paper I introduce breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) algorithms, together with their properties and analyze which algorithm is most applicable for use as a Web crawler. Both BFS and DFS are tree-search algorithms which return a spanning tree and therefore can be used to determine whether a given graph is connected. This paper starts with theoretical background needed for tree search algorithms, introduces BFS and DFS, gives examples of both algorithms and finally analyses which one is most applicable for Web crawling given the intricacies of this process.
